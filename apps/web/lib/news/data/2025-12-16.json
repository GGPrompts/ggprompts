    "summary": "The claude-mem plugin shot up GitHub trending today, gaining 633 stars as developers embrace persistent memory for Claude Code sessions. Built using Claude's agent-sdk, it automatically captures everything Claude does during coding sessions, compresses the activity with AI, and injects relevant context back into future sessions.",
    "whyItMatters": "This addresses the #1 frustration with AI coding agents: context amnesia. Every new session starts from scratch, forcing developers to re-explain their codebase, preferences, and project state. Claude-mem creates a continuous memory layer that makes each session smarter than the last. The explosive adoption signals that 'stateful AI' is becoming a must-have, not a nice-to-have.",
