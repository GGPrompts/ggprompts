    "summary": "OpenAI released GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, their new frontier agentic coding model built on an updated reasoning foundation. The model is faster, more intelligent, and more token-efficient at every stage of development. As of December 4, it's rolling out to GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise users.",
    "whyItMatters": "This marks a significant leap for AI-assisted coding. GPT-5.1-Codex-Max includes native Windows support (a first for Codex models), extra-high reasoning effort mode for complex tasks, and is now the default in the Codex CLI. The model is also available in Cursor, Linear, and other tools via API access.",
