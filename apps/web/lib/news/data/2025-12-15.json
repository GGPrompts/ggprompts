    "summary": "SimStudioAI's open-source platform for building and deploying AI agent workflows shot to the top of GitHub trending with 1,463 stars today. The TypeScript-based visual workflow builder lets developers and non-technical users alike orchestrate multiple AI agents, chain prompts, and deploy complex automation workflows without writing code.",
    "whyItMatters": "This signals growing demand for visual, no-code approaches to AI agent orchestration. As agents become more capable, the bottleneck shifts from 'can AI do this?' to 'how do I coordinate multiple agents?' Sim Studio's explosive growth shows developers want Zapier-like simplicity for agent workflows, not just raw API access.",
