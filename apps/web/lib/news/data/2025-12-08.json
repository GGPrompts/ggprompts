    "summary": "A busy week for OpenAI's Codex: they patched CVE-2025-61260, a critical command injection vulnerability (CVSS 9.8) that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands via malicious .env files. Meanwhile, GPT-5.1-Codex-Max entered public preview in GitHub Copilot—the first model natively trained for multi-context 'compaction' across millions of tokens.",
    "whyItMatters": "The security patch reveals how agentic AI tools create new attack surfaces—Codex CLI's trust of .env files allowed supply chain attacks without user interaction. The GPT-5.1-Codex-Max release represents a paradigm shift: models designed from the ground up for long-running, multi-file tasks rather than single-prompt interactions. This is where AI coding is heading.",
