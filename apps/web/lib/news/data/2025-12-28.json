    "summary": "A new Rust-based kanban board called vibe-kanban is trending on GitHub with 144 stars today, designed specifically to help developers get '10X more' out of coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and other AI assistants. The tool provides structured task management optimized for AI-driven workflows.",
    "whyItMatters": "As AI coding assistants become more sophisticated, developers need better ways to organize and delegate tasks to them. Vibe-kanban represents a growing category of tools that sit between the developer and the AI agent, providing the structure and context that helps agents work more effectively. This is the 'context engineering' approach in action.",
