    "summary": "Anthropic's Claude Code has reached a staggering $1 billion in run-rate revenue just six months after its May 2025 public launch. Now the company is bringing Claude Code directly into Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks from chat threads with automatic repository analysis, progress updates, and PR creation.",
    "whyItMatters": "Claude Code in Slack transforms the 32-million-user platform into an AI-powered development environment. Developers can tag @Claude in a bug report thread, and it will spin up a complete coding session, analyze context from recent messages, work in the right repository, and share links to review changes. This isn't just another chatbot—it's enterprise-grade agentic coding embedded where teams already collaborate.",
