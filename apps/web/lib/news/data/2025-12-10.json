The foundation aims to create universal standards for how AI agents interact with tools, codebases, and each other.",
    "whyItMatters": "This signals a fundamental shift from proprietary AI walled gardens to collaborative infrastructure. With both Anthropic and OpenAI contributing their agent communication standards to a neutral foundation, developers can build agents that work across platforms. The 'agent protocol wars' may be ending before they truly began—and everyone building AI tools wins.",
