    "summary": "Harvard Edge Computing group's 'Introduction to Machine Learning Systems' book has gone viral on GitHub, gaining 1,144 stars in a single day. The comprehensive open-source textbook covers everything from ML fundamentals to edge deployment, TinyML, and efficient inference—positioning it as the definitive resource for understanding ML systems holistically.",
    "whyItMatters": "This signals a fundamental shift in ML education. As AI coding tools like Claude Code and Codex become mainstream, developers need deeper systems-level understanding—not just prompt engineering. Harvard making this knowledge freely available democratizes access to production ML knowledge that was previously siloed in elite institutions.",
