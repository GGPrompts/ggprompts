    "summary": "Anthropic announced it is donating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to the Linux Foundation's newly established Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) on December 9, 2025. The foundation is co-founded by Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI with support from Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare, and Bloomberg, marking an unprecedented collaboration in the AI industry.",
    "whyItMatters": "This is a watershed moment for AI interoperability. MCP, which powers context sharing across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and countless developer tools, is now industry-neutral infrastructure. The AAIF's founding members represent virtually every major player in AI, signaling that agentic AI standards are too important to be controlled by any single company. For developers, this means MCP investments are now future-proof.",
