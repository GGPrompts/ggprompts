    "summary": "OpenAI released GPT-5.2-Codex, their most advanced agentic coding model optimized for security and long-horizon work. A researcher using the previous version already discovered three CVEs in React Server Components. The new model scores 56.4% on SWE-Bench Pro and 64% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, with significantly stronger cybersecurity capabilities.",
    "whyItMatters": "This marks a fundamental shift in AI coding tools—from 'write code faster' to 'write secure code.' GPT-5.2-Codex's ability to find real-world vulnerabilities in production frameworks like React signals a new era where AI becomes a serious force in defensive security. For prompt engineers, this means integrating security-focused prompting patterns into coding workflows.",
