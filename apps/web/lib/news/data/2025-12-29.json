    "summary": "Anthropic and Accenture announced a major multi-year strategic partnership on December 9, making Accenture a premier AI partner for coding. The Accenture Anthropic Business Group will train approximately 30,000 professionals on Claude Code, which reportedly hit $1 billion in run-rate revenue just six months after its May 2025 public launch.",
    "whyItMatters": "This signals enterprise AI adoption reaching a new phase. With 30,000 Accenture developers getting Claude Code access, we're seeing the largest enterprise rollout of agentic coding tools to date. The $1B run-rate figure confirms that AI coding assistants have become a core infrastructure investment, not just a developer productivity experiment.",
