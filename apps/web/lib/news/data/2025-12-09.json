    "summary": "Anthropic is launching Claude Code directly in Slack, enabling developers to delegate coding tasks from chat threads. Tag @Claude to spin up coding sessions using Slack context—bug reports, feature requests, conversation history—and watch as Claude posts progress updates and opens PRs. The timing coincides with Claude Code hitting $1 billion in annualized revenue, just six months after GA.",
    "whyItMatters": "This isn't just another Slack bot. Claude Code in Slack represents the next frontier: AI agents that live where developers already collaborate. By reading thread context to understand intent, automatically selecting repos, and posting updates asynchronously, Anthropic is betting that the best AI UX is invisible—embedded in existing workflows rather than requiring context-switching to new tools.",
