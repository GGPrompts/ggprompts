    "summary": "A critical serialization injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-68664) dubbed 'LangGrinch' was disclosed in langchain-core on Christmas Eve, affecting one of the most widely-used LLM orchestration libraries with 98 million monthly downloads. Attackers can exploit prompt injection to extract environment variable secrets and instantiate arbitrary objects.",
    "whyItMatters": "LangChain is foundational infrastructure for AI agents—this isn't a niche bug, it's in the core serialization APIs (dumps/dumpd). The vulnerability turns prompt injection into secret theft, highlighting that agentic AI systems face compounding security risks. With 847 million total downloads affected, this is a wake-up call for the entire LLM ecosystem on Christmas morning.",
