    "summary": "OpenAI released GPT-5.2 on December 11, their most capable model series yet, featuring 400K token context, August 2025 knowledge cutoff, and three variants (Instant, Thinking, Pro). The launch comes just one month after GPT-5.1, following CEO Sam Altman's internal 'code red' memo about losing market share to Google.",
    "whyItMatters": "This aggressive release cadence signals intensifying competition in the AI space. GPT-5.2's improved coding, spreadsheet creation, and long-context capabilities make it a direct competitor to Claude Opus 4.5 for professional knowledge work. The 1.4x price increase also hints at sustainable AI business models emerging.",
