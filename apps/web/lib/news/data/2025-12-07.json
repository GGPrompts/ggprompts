    "summary": "Just weeks after acquiring Bun, Anthropic confirmed Claude Code has reached $1 billion in annualized run-rate revenue—achieving this milestone in only six months since public launch. The acquisition signals Anthropic's aggressive push into developer infrastructure, combining the world's fastest JavaScript runtime with the leading agentic coding assistant.",
    "whyItMatters": "This is the fastest revenue ramp in AI tooling history. With Bun's runtime capabilities now under Anthropic's roof, expect deeper integrations: faster package installations, native AI-aware tooling, and performance optimizations that could fundamentally change how Claude Code operates. The $1B milestone also validates the 'agentic coding' category as a major revenue driver.",
