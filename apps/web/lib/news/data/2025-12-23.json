    "summary": "OpenAI released GPT-5.2-Codex, achieving 56.4% on SWE-Bench Pro—besting all other coding models. The release comes with a dramatic proof of capability: a security researcher using GPT-5.1-Codex-Max discovered CVE-2025-55182 (CVSS 10.0) in React Server Components, plus three additional previously unknown vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-55183, CVE-2025-55184, CVE-2025-67779).",
    "whyItMatters": "This marks a turning point where AI coding assistants become serious security research tools. GPT-5.2-Codex features enhanced cybersecurity capabilities, context compaction for long-horizon work, and improved refactoring. With Codex usage growing 20x since August, and enterprise customers like Cisco and Duolingo onboard, we're entering the era of AI-assisted vulnerability hunting.",
