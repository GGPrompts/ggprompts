    "summary": "OpenAI released GPT-5.2-Codex on December 18, 2025, achieving an unprecedented 56.4% on SWE-Bench Pro and 64% on Terminal-Bench 2.0. The model features context compaction for long-horizon work, stronger refactoring and migration capabilities, improved Windows support, and significantly enhanced cybersecurity capabilities that already led to discovering CVEs in React.",
    "whyItMatters": "This release intensifies the agentic coding wars. With Claude Code at $1B revenue, Gemini 3 Flash hitting 78% SWE-bench, and now GPT-5.2-Codex pushing benchmarks further, developers have never had more powerful AI coding options. The cybersecurity angle is particularly notable - a researcher using GPT-5.1-Codex-Max found and disclosed React vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-55183, CVE-2025-55184, CVE-2025-67779) just last week.",
