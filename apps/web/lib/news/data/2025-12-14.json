    "summary": "The Linux Foundation has launched the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) with unprecedented industry backing. Anthropic is donating MCP (Model Context Protocol), Block contributes Goose (their internal agent framework used by thousands of engineers), and OpenAI provides AGENTS.md (now adopted by 60,000+ open-source projects). AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, and Microsoft joined at launch.",
    "whyItMatters": "This is the most significant standardization effort in AI agent history. With MCP becoming vendor-neutral infrastructure, developers won't need endless one-off adapters between AI tools. The fact that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Block are collaborating rather than competing on infrastructure signals a mature industry prioritizing interoperability over lock-in.",
