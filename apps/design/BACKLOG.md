## Won't Do (Parking Lot)

Track ideas we've decided NOT to pursue (and why):

- **React Three Fiber integration** - Too heavy for portfolio use case, adds 100KB+ bundle
- **Tailwind v4** - Still in beta, stick with stable v3
- **Full code editor in browser** - Scope creep, focus on prompt generation
